## Team

Bootstrap Table is maintained by [wenzhixin](https://github.com/wenzhixin), [djhvscf](https://github.com/djhvscf) and [UtechtDustin](https://github.com/UtechtDustin) on GitHub. We're actively looking to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you're excited about CSS at scale, writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript plugins, and improving build tooling processes for frontend code.
