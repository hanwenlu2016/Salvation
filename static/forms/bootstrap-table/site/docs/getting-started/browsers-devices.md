## Supported browsers

Bootstrap Table supports the **latest, stable releases** of all major browsers and platforms. On Windows, **we support Internet Explorer 10-11 / Microsoft Edge**.

Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform's web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap Table should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support information is provided below.

You can find our supported range of browsers and their versions [in our `.browserslistrc file`]({{ site.repo }}/blob/{{ site.current_version }}/.browserslistrc):

```

Because Bootstrap Table is designed for Bootstrap, we will try to be consistent with Bootstrap in browsers and devices compatibility, for more detail, you can checkout the [browsers-devices of Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/browsers-devices/).
